# Database Project at Gdańsk University of Technology
 As part of the "Databases" course at Gdańsk University of Technology, I completed a project focused on creating an advanced database that collects data on football clubs and football seasons. The goal of the project was to design, implement, and test a database that would enable comprehensive management of information related to various aspects of football clubs' operations and their performance in different seasons.
